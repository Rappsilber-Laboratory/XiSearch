## how many cpus to use
## values smaller 0 mean that all avaiblable but the mentioned number will be used
## e.g. if the computer has 4 cores and UseCPUs is set to -1 then 3 threads are used for search.
## this is a bit relativated by the buffering, as buffers also use threads to decouple the input and output of the buffer.
## each thread will also have a small buffer between itself and the input and the output queue - but the overal cpu-usage of these should be smallish
UseCPUs:-1

## format :
## crosslinker:SymetricSingleAminoAcidRestrictedCrossLinker:Name:[name];MASS:[cross-linker mass];LINKEDAMINOACIDS:[list of possible cross-link targts];MODIFICATIONS:[list of associated modifications];decoy
## with:
##  Name:             A name of the cross-linker
##  MASS:             The mass of the cross-linker as  the difference between the mass of the two peptides and the mass of the mass of the two peptides when reacted with the cross-linker
##  LINKEDAMINOACIDS: A comma separated list of amino-acids that the cross-linker can react with. Additionaly nterm and cterm are accepted
##                    Also amino-acids can get a ranking by defining a penelty (between 0 and 1) for them.
##                    E.g. K(0),S(0.2),T(0.2),Y(0.2),nterm(0) means that K and the protein n-terminal are more likely to be cross-linked then S, T, or Y
## MODIFICATIONS:     a comma-separeted list defining related modifications 
##                    E.g. NH3,17.026549105,OH2,18.0105647                  
##                    defines two modifications:
##                      NH3: that adds 17.026549105 to the mass of the cross-linker
##                      OH2: that adds 18.0105647 to the mass of the cross-linker
## LINAERMODIFICATIONS: same as MODIFICATIONS but will only be applied to linear peptides
## LOSSES:            a comma-separeted list defining crosslinker related losses
##                    E.g. X,10,Y120
##                    defines two losses:
##                      X: a loss of 10Da from the cross-linker
##                      Y: a loss of 120Da from the cross-linker
## STUBS:            a comma-separeted list defining crosslinker stubs for MS-cleavable cross-linker 
##                    E.g. A,54.0105647,S,103.9932001,T,85.9826354
##                    defines three cross-linker stubs:
##                      A: with mass 54.0105647
##                      S: with mass 103.9932001
##                      T: with mass 85.9826354
##
## additionally one can also define heterobifunctional cross-linker
## crosslinker:AsymetricSingleAminoAcidRestrictedCrossLinker:Name:[name];MASS:[cross-linker mass];FIRSTLINKEDAMINOACIDS:[list of possible cross-link targts];SECONDLINKEDAMINOACIDS:[list of possible cross-link targts]
## syntax is similare to homobifinctional crosslinker with two changes:
## two sets of specificities FIRSTLINKEDAMINOACIDS and SECONDLINKEDAMINOACIDS and modifications cant be defined together with the cross-linker

##Modifications
## modifications are possible to be defined as three types:
## fixed: every aminoacid is modified
## variable: peptides containing the aminoacids will be searched with and without modification
## known: not automatically searched - but enables to defined modification as part of the FASTA-file as fixed or variable modification (e.g. defined histon modification 
##         only on histones without haveing to search them everywhere).
## linear: peptides with that modification will only be searched as linear peptides (not part of an cross-link)
## 
## Format is: 
##        modification:(fixed|variable|known)::SYMBOL:(how is the modification represented);MODIFIED:[aminoaid];MASS:[mass of the modified amino acid]
##  Symbol:      peptides will be reported with the modification as part of the 
##               sequence the symbol to represent the modified amino acid
##               Ccm for Carboxyamidomethylation of Cysteine
##  MODIFIED:    the amni-acid to be modified (e.g. C)
##  MASS:        the total mass of the modified amino acid
##   (This format is also used to define amino-acid substitution)
##
## Alternativly modifications that apply to several aminoacids can also be defined as
##         modification:variable::SYMBOLEXT:[extension];MODIFIED:[amino-acids];DELTAMASS:[mass-difference]
##  SYMBOLEXT:   What will be appended to the amino-acid to denote this modification (E.g. ox for oxidation)
##  MODIFIED:    A list of aminoa cids that can have this modification
##  DELTAMASS:   the mass diference between the modified and teh undmodified version of the amino-acid.

## we need the run name and scan number for a spectrum
## but mgf-files have that info (if at all) in the TITLE line
## and it is not exactly defined how that is stored
## some mgf-files that we have encountered are already regognised for others
## the following to regular expressions can be defined to read out scan number and run
## if both are supplied these will be first tried before the internal automatic will be used
## the scan number and the raw file need to be in the first capturing group
## Example:
## the mgf contains headers like:
## TITLE= Elution from: -1.0 to -1.0 period:  experiment:  cycles:  precIntensity: -1.0 RawFile: myrawfile FinneganScanNumber: 14846
## then the regular expressions should be defined as
## SCAN_RE: .*FinneganScanNumber:\s*([0-9]*)\s*
## RUN_RE: .*RawFile:\s*(.*)FinneganScanNumber:

## XiSearch comes with a range of know regulare mgf-title formats but there are a lot
